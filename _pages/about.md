Hello! My name is Yvette, and I'm passionate about harnessing the power of data science to solve complex problems. 

My work spans from health sciences to financial strategies, where I utilize machine learning to develop robust investment and data analysis tools. I'm currently volunteering at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, working on research into children ADHD using diffusion tensor imaging. 

I’m always keen to collaborate on projects that leverage my skills in Python, R, SQL, and machine learning. If you're interested in a data-driven approach to complex problems, let’s chat about how we can work together!
